<br>How can one dissect the depth of this phrase? Probably it is wise to begin with defining the key words—Piety and Cleric. 
<br>
<br>As defined in spiritual terminology, piety is a virtue. While different people may understand its meaning differently, it is generally used to refer either to religious devotion or to spirituality, or often, a combination of both. A common element in most conceptions of piety is humility. 
<br>
<br>Where does this word come from? 
<br>
<br>The word piety comes from the Latin word pietas, the noun form of the adjective pius (which means "devout" or "good"). Pietas in traditional Latin usage expressed a complex, highly valued Roman virtue; a man with pietas respected his responsibilities to other people, gods and entities (such as the state), and understood his place in society with respect to others. That doesn't mean others will understand it. In its strictest sense it was the sort of love a son ought to have for his father.
<br>Piety in modern English usage can refer to a way to win the favor or forgiveness of God. According to some, this type of piety does not necessarily require the spiritual piety, while others refrain from distinguishing the two.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, according to references, the term cleric refers to any individual who has received the clerical tonsure, including deacons, priests and bishops. The term clerk derives from cleric, since in medieval times the clergy were one of the few groups who could read, and therefore were often employed to do bookkeeping and similar work. The term clerical work continues to this day to refer to such functions. Types of clerics are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. 
<br>
<br>Now, putting this together, we can say that in every learning experience of a human being, there should always be values or virtues along with acquiring new knowledge.  For without it, an individual is nothing but a boastful ordinary person.  Same goes with a person or a cleric with so much virtues or spiritual piety but lack in knowledge or learning new things is considered useless.
<br>
<br>In a sense, there should always be a balance in everything.  Ora et Labora—PRAYER and WORK that is.
